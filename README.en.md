Connect multiple LLM providers to multiple communication channels with composable tools, scheduling, browser automation, and more — all from a single deployment.

---

## Features

- **Multi-LLM-Provider** — OpenAI, Anthropic, Bytedance/Doubao, Xiaomi MiMo, and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Switch LLM providers per channel or per message route.
- **Multi-Channel** — Feishu/Lark, WeCom, QQ. Each channel gets streaming responses and attachment handling. Feishu additionally supports interactive card UI and multiple bot apps per channel.
- **Composable Tools** — Bash, file I/O, web search (Tavily, Exa), RSS, TTS, memory, scheduling, and more. Enable or disable tool groups via config.
- **Skills System** — Built-in skills (weather, DOCX/XLSX generation, frontend design, etc.) plus user-defined custom skills.
- **Task Scheduler** — Fixed interval, cron expression, or one-time scheduled tasks that execute through the full agent pipeline.
- **Browser Automation** — Built-in `browser` tool group drives a real browser via [agent-browser](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser), with isolated per-session profiles, CDP mode for reusing your local Chrome, and automatic fallback to isolation when CDP is unreachable.
- **Web Dashboard** — First-run setup wizard and config management UI with i18n (English/Chinese) and provider connection testing.
- **Extended Thinking** — Reasoning effort control for OpenAI and adaptive thinking for Anthropic models.
- **Long-Term Memory** — Cognitive-memory-inspired model with four types (semantic / procedural / episodic / prospective) split across global and per-channel scopes. Each entry is a single Markdown file with frontmatter; a per-scope `MEMORY.md` index is always loaded into the system prompt. LLM-based duplicate detection prevents redundant writes.
- **Session Management** — Persistent message routes with message history and channel-to-message-route bindings.
- **Auto-New Route + Recap** — When a route goes idle past a threshold, the next message starts a fresh route automatically and the old route is asynchronously summarized into a structured recap (goal / decisions / changes / todos), archived into `route.recaps[]`, and announced to the chat. Manual `/recap` is also available.

## Prerequisites

- An API key for at least one supported LLM provider
- Channel credentials (Feishu app, WeCom bot, or QQ bot) for the platforms you want to connect
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) is only required when running from source; pre-built binaries need no runtime

## Getting Started

### Option 1: Pre-built Binary (Recommended)

Download the binary for your platform from [Releases](https://github.com/LiangNiang/OpenMantis/releases) — no Bun or dependencies needed:

```bash
chmod +x openmantis-linux-x64
./openmantis-linux-x64 init      # Extract built-in skills
./openmantis-linux-x64 start     # Start daemon
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> macOS users: binaries downloaded from GitHub Releases get tagged with the `com.apple.quarantine` attribute and may be blocked by Gatekeeper on first run ("cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified"). Remove the quarantine attribute:
>
> ```bash
> xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ./openmantis-darwin-arm64
> chmod +x ./openmantis-darwin-arm64
> ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Windows users: do not double-click the `.exe` — it is a CLI program, and double-clicking only flashes a black console window that disappears. Open **PowerShell** or **CMD**, `cd` to the binary's directory, then run:
>
> ```powershell
> .\openmantis-windows-x64.exe init      # Extract built-in skills
> .\openmantis-windows-x64.exe start     # Start daemon
> ```

### Option 2: From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LiangNiang/OpenMantis.git
cd OpenMantis
bun install
bun run dev                      # Dev mode (foreground)
```

### First-Time Setup

On first start, OpenMantis automatically launches a **setup wizard** at `http://127.0.0.1:7777` — follow the steps to configure your provider, channels, and tools. Restart after setup to apply changes.

Runtime data is stored in `~/.openmantis/` (customizable via `OPENMANTIS_DATA_DIR` environment variable).

### CLI Commands

```bash
openmantis start       # Start daemon
openmantis stop        # Stop
openmantis restart     # Restart
openmantis status      # Show running status
openmantis log         # Tail log file
openmantis run         # Run in foreground (for Docker or debugging)
openmantis init        # Extract built-in skills (--force to overwrite)
```

## Usage Examples

| | Description |
|---|---|
| ![Feishu Tools Call](examples/imgs/01.gif) | Feishu channel showing tools invocation with auto-collapse on completion |
| ![Scheduled Tasks](examples/imgs/02.gif) | Scheduled tasks |
| ![Memory](examples/imgs/03.gif) | Memory saving and recall |

## Architecture

![Architecture](assets/architecture.en.svg)

Messages flow from a channel adapter into the **Gateway**, which manages sessions (message routes) and creates agents. The **AgentFactory** assembles the LLM provider, tools, and system prompt (including the `MEMORY.md` indices) for each turn, then delegates to a **ToolLoopAgent** for streaming execution. The **Scheduler** can also trigger the full agent pipeline on cron / interval / at schedules.

## Tools

Tools are organized into groups and can be toggled via the `excludeTools` config array:

| Group | Tools | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `bash` | `bash`, `bash_write`, `bash_wait`, `bash_kill` | PTY-based shell execution with timeout, interactive input, and session management |

| `message` | `send_message` | Send messages to specified channels (always injected when gateway context available) |

Channel-specific tools (Feishu file uploads, doc creation, etc.) are injected automatically based on the active channel.

## Skills

Built-in skills are extracted to `~/.openmantis/skills/builtin/` on first run via `openmantis init`. Custom skills go in `~/.openmantis/skills/custom/`.

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `docx` | Create, read, edit, and manipulate Word documents (.docx) |
| `xlsx` | Work with spreadsheet files (.xlsx, .xlsm, .csv, .tsv) |
| `weather` | Get current weather and forecasts via wttr.in or Open-Meteo |
| `frontend-design` | Generate production-grade frontend interfaces (React components, dashboards, etc.) |
| `skill-manager` | Manage the complete lifecycle of OpenMantis skills (create, discover, install, audit) |

## Slash Commands

Users interact with the agent via `/` commands in chat:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/help` | Show available commands |
| `/new` | Start a new message route |
| `/clear [id]` | Delete a message route (without id, deletes the current route and switches to a fresh one) |
| `/stop` | Force-stop the in-flight conversation |
| `/list` | List all message routes |
| `/history` | Show current message route messages |
| `/resume <id>` | Resume a previous message route |
| `/recap` | Generate a structured recap of the current route and archive it (goal / decisions / changes / todos) |
| `/channel` | Show current channel type and ID |
| `/schedule <list\|delete\|pause\|resume>` | Manage scheduled tasks |
| `/voice [on\|off]` | Toggle TTS voice mode (Feishu/WeCom only) |
| `/remember <content>` | Hint to the agent to call `save_memory` next turn (v2 no longer writes directly from the command — the agent decides type/subject) |
| `/forget <keyword>` | Fuzzy-match name/description across global + current channel; deletes the file and removes the entry from `MEMORY.md` |
| `/memories` | Show the `MEMORY.md` indices (global + current channel) |
| `/bot-open-id` | Show bot open_id (Feishu only) |
| `/open-id` | Show your Feishu open_id |

## Browser Automation

OpenMantis drives a real browser via the built-in `browser` tool group, backed by the [agent-browser](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser) CLI.

```bash
npm install -g agent-browser
agent-browser install   # downloads Chrome
```

Enable in config:

```json
{
  "browser": {
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

The agent drives the browser through three tools:

- **`browser_help`** — Loads version-matched agent-browser docs (snapshot/ref workflow, common commands). Call this before non-trivial work.
- **`browser`** — Runs an agent-browser subcommand (e.g. `["open", "https://..."]`, `["snapshot", "-i"]`). Session flags (`--session`, `--profile`, `--cdp`, `--auto-connect`) are injected automatically and will be rejected if passed in `args`. For stdin subcommands like `eval --stdin`, pass the content via the `stdin` field.
- **`browser_kill`** — Force-terminates a stuck session (prefer increasing `timeout` over killing).

Each message route gets an isolated browser profile. For reusing your local Chrome session, enable **CDP mode**:

```bash
google-chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222
```

If the CDP port is unreachable, `browser` automatically falls back to isolation mode for 60 seconds and prefixes its output with `[⚠️ CDP unreachable, ran in isolation mode]`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In CDP mode, conversations share your real browser (cookies, sessions, tabs). Avoid pointing the agent at sensitive accounts.

## Scheduler

Three scheduling modes for automated tasks:

- **`every`** — Fixed interval (e.g., every 30 minutes)
- **`cron`** — 5-field cron expression with timezone support (default: `Asia/Shanghai`)
- **`at`** — One-time execution at a specific datetime

Tasks execute through the full agent pipeline and results are delivered to the originating channel.

## Memory System

A cognitive-memory-inspired model with four types, organized across **global** and per-**channel** scopes. Each entry is a single Markdown file with frontmatter; a per-scope `MEMORY.md` index is always injected into the system prompt, and individual files are read on demand by the agent.

![Memory System](assets/memory.en.svg)

| Type | Cognitive analogue | Use | Required structure |
|---|---|---|---|
| `semantic` | Semantic memory | Stable facts about a subject (user identity, third-party entities, external resource pointers) | Free-form body |
| `procedural` | Procedural memory | How the agent should behave (persona, style, corrections, restrictions) | Body must contain `**Why:**` and `**How to apply:**` |
| `episodic` | Episodic memory | Past events worth remembering long-term (illness, job change, family events, etc.) | Frontmatter must include `when` (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `prospective` | Prospective memory | Future plans / commitments | Frontmatter must include `trigger` or `deadline` |

**Subject** is a frontmatter metadata field: `user` / `agent` / `world` / `reference`.

**Two layers of duplicate defense**:
1. The agent reads the injected `MEMORY.md` index and proactively skips writes for things it already knows.
2. When `save_memory` is called, `detectConflictV2` uses an LLM to judge duplicate / conflict and suggests `update_memory` instead.

**Index limits**: `MEMORY.md` soft-warns at 400 lines and hard-caps at 500. Hitting the hard cap rejects the write and rolls back the file that was just created.

## Auto-New Route & Recap

Long-running chats accumulate stale history and pollute the context. OpenMantis manages session boundaries automatically via **idle-triggered new routes + structured recap archival**, so users don't have to remember `/new`.

**Trigger flow**: when a new message arrives and the bound route has been idle for more than `idleMinutes` (default 120), the gateway:

1. Creates a fresh empty route and rebinds the channel to it.
2. If the old route has ≥ 3 messages and `recap` is enabled, **asynchronously** asks the LLM to generate a four-section recap (`goal` / `decisions` / `changes` / `todos`) and appends it to `oldRoute.recaps[]`.
3. Prepends a one-line notice to the first reply on the new route: `🆕 Idle over X minutes — started a new conversation (old route archived, run /list to find it)`.
4. After the recap completes, pushes a separate dim notice to the channel: `📋 Previous conversation archived: {heading} (run /list)`. Feishu/WeCom render it in grey; QQ falls back to plain text.

Recap is fire-and-forget — recap failure never blocks the main reply, and notify failure never rolls back the persisted recap.

**Config** (`autoNewRoute`, also editable in the web dashboard's Advanced section):

```json
{
  "autoNewRoute": {
    "enabled": true,
    "idleMinutes": 120,
    "recap": true
  }
}
```

- `enabled`: when off, routes never auto-switch (original behavior — only manual `/new`).
- `idleMinutes`: positive integer; how long before a route is considered "done."
- `recap`: when off, the route still switches but no summary is generated and no archival notice is pushed.

`/recap` can be invoked at any time to synchronously summarize the current route on demand.
